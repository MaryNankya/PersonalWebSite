<h2>Project 1: Optimization of Massive MIMO and Millimeter Wave Systems </h2>
<p> With globalization, present-day networks are facing high traffic demands and fulfilling these demands, the cellular systems are deployed within a few hundred-meter distances, and wireless Local Area Networks (LAN) are placed almost everywhere. Along with increased mobile broadband service, the introduction of new concepts like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine Communication (M2M) are also contributing to the increased wireless traffic. With the current technology and designs, either bandwidth or cell density is increased to fulfill the user demand. But these resources are reaching their saturation point; furthermore, the increase in bandwidth and cell densification makes the system more expensive, increases latency, and decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. However, with these other improvements, the third factor affecting area throughput, spectral efficiency, has remained mostly untouched and unchanged. Therefore, to achieve the goals of the 5G and beyond networks, it is highly desirable to improve the area throughput by increasing the spectral efficiency rather than by increasing bandwidth or cell density. </p>

<p> Massive MIMO (Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output) is the most enthralling sub-6 GHz wireless access technology to deliver the needs of future generation networks, which brings together antennas, radios, and spectrum to enable higher capacity and speed. My current research work focuses on overcoming several implementation issues for the massive MIMO technology — improving signal detection, design of robust user scheduling algorithms, mitigation of pilot contamination, and hardware architecture designs. More broadly, my goal is to optimize massive MIMO systems to achieve all the goals promised by 5G and beyond networks. </p>

<h2>Project 2: Investigate Key Enabling Technologies for Future Generation Networks </h2>
  <p> Smart devices and mobile phones drive the exponential growth of wireless data traffic. The future generation networks must address the increasing demand for higher data rates, lower latency, low power consumption, and ubiquitous connectivity. Key enabling technologies to implement 5G and beyond networks are millimeter waves, terahertz communication, beamforming, small cells, and device-centric architecture. This project will investigate all the key enabling technologies to improve data rate, latency, reliability, and energy efficiency. </p>

<h2>Project 3: IoT for Smart Cities, Consumer Electronics, and Smart Home </h2>

<p>Internet of Things (IoT) can reduce the burden of urbanization; by making sustainable use of environmental resources and infrastructure, enhancing the quality of life, and improving public safety. However, the realization of IoT systems depends on various factors, such as security, energy efficiency, reliability, and performance. These factors impose several hardware, software, system design, and implementation issues. <p>
